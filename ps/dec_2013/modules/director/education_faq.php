<b>Q1. What is an Accord?</b>
<br/>
An agreement among the bodies responsible for accrediting specific degree programs in each of the signatory countries. 
Accords recognize the substantial equivalency of programs accredited by each of these bodies and 
recommends that graduates of accredited programs in any of the signatory countries be recognized by the other 
countries as having met the academic requirements for entry-level practice. 
Accords are intended to improve technical education worldwide and foster the mobility of students and graduates.

<br/>

<br/>
<b>Q5. What are Program Educational Objectives(PEOs)?</b>
<br/>


Broad statements that describe what graduates are expected to attain within a few years of graduation. 
Program educational objectives are based on the needs of the program's constituencies.
Program educational objectives are broad statements that describe the career and professional accomplishments 
that the program is preparing the graduates to achieve.

<br/>
<b>Q6. What are Program Outcomes (POs)?</b>
<br/>


Statements that describe what students are expected to know and be able to do by the time of graduation. 
These relate to skills, knowledge, and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through the program.

<br/>
<b>Q7. What are Course Outcomes (COs)?</b>
<br/>


Course outcomes are statements of what a student should know, understand and/or be able to demonstrate after completion of a  course.

<br/>
<b>Q8. What is Assessment?</b>
<br/>


Assessment tells us what our students are learning and how well they are learning that material. 
Assessment is an ongoing process in which faculty and administrators determine what knowledge and skills students should be learning. 
It is one or more processes that identify, collect, and prepare data to evaluate the achievement of course outcomes, program outcomes 
and program educational objectives.

<br/>
<b>Q9. What is Evaluation? </b>
<br/>


It is one or more processes for interpreting the data and evidence accumulated through assessment practices. 
Evaluation determines the extent to which program outcomes or program educational objectives are 
being achieved and results in decisions and actions to improve the program.

<br/>
<b>Q10. What are Direct Assessment Methods?</b>
<br/>


Direct methods display the student’s knowledge and skills from their performance in the continuous assessment tests, 
end-semester examinations, presentations,  classroom assignments , Projects, Tutorials, and Labs etc.

<br/>
<b>Q11. What are Indirect Assessment Methods?</b>
<br/>


Indirect measures can provide information about graduate’s perception of their learning and how this learning is valued by different stakeholders.
For example: Rubrics,Alumni survey,Employer survey,Course embedded survey, etc.

<br/>
<b>Q12. Describe rubrics.</b>
<br/>


Rubrics are a way to set up custom or Outcome-based assessment criteria for scoring.
A Rubric is an assessment tool for communicating expectations of quality. Rubrics are typically comprised of rows and columns. Rows are used to define the various criteria being used to assess an assignment. Columns are used to define levels of performance for each criterion.
Teachers have found rubrics to be every useful in providing guidance and feedback to students where skills and processes are the targets being monitored.
Rubrics enable teachers to evaluate students' performance in situations that more closely replicate real life than an isolated test. Rubrics also help teachers to focus their own attention to the key concepts and standards that the students must obtain.
Rubrics provide students with a clear understanding of what is expected of them. Students have concrete directions about what makes a good science project, a good persuasive writing piece, etc.. Many studies have proven that rubrics improve students' end products and thus increase the students' overall learning. Rubrics provide students with valuable information about the degree of which a specific learning outcome has been achieved. They provide students with concrete feedback that displays areas of strength and areas in need of improvement. 
Students can use this feedback as a tool to further develop their abilities.
Rubrics encourage students to think about their own thinking and possibly about their own criteria for what is "good.": to analyze their own work and process to see how it matches up with the standard explained in the rubric. By using rubrics, teachers give students experience in their higher-level thinking processes.
Parents appreciate the use of rubrics because they allow teachers to justify why a certain grade was assigned to his/her child.

<br/>
<b>Q13. Describe Outcomes Based Education(OBE).</b>
<br/>


Outcomes Based Education focuses on student learning by:
•Using learning outcome statements to make explicit 
what the student is expected to be able to know,understand or do;
•Providing learning activities which will help the student to reach these outcomes;
•Assessing the extent to which the student meets these outcomes through the use of explicit assessment criteria.

<br/>
<b>Q14. What is Vision statement?</b>
<br/>


Vision is a futuristic statement that the institution / department would like to achieve over a long period of time.

<br/>
<b>Q15. What are mission statements?</b>
<br/>


Mission statements are action statements to achieve the vision.

<br/>
<b>Q15. Describe Bloom's Taxonomy.</b>
<br/>

Bloom's Taxonomy was created in 1956 under the leadership of educational psychologist Dr Benjamin Bloom in order to promote higher forms of thinking in education, such as analyzing and evaluating, rather than just remembering facts (rote learning).

The committee identified three domains of educational activities or learning (Bloom, 1956):
Cognitive: mental skills (Knowledge)
Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas (Attitude or self)
Psychomotor: manual or physical skills (Skills)
Trainers often refer to these three categories as KSA (Knowledge, Skills, and Attitude). This taxonomy of learning behaviors can be thought of as “the goals of the learning process.” That is, after a learning episode, the learner should have acquired new skills, knowledge, and/or attitudes.

<br/>
<b>Q16. Describe Revised Bloom's Taxonomy or Anderson and Krathwohl's Taxonomy ?</b>
<br/>


Anderson and Krathwohl (2001) revised Bloom's Taxonomy.
The revised Bloom taxonomy gives slightly different names to the 6 levels of the hierarchy:
remember (was knowledge)
understand (was comprehension)
apply (was application)
analyze (was analysis)
evaluate (was evaluation)
create (was synthesis)

Different levels of thinking are described as:

<br/>1. Remember – recalling relevant terminology, specific facts, or different procedures related to information and/or course topics. At this level, a student can remember something, but may not really understand it. 

<br/>2. Understand – the ability to grasp the meaning of information (facts, definitions, concepts, etc.) that has been presented. 

<br/>3. Apply – being able to use previously learned information in different situations or in problem solving. 

<br/>4. Analyze – the ability to break information down into its component parts. Analysis also refers to the process of examining information in order to make conclusions regarding cause and effect, interpreting motives, making inferences, or finding evidence to support statements/arguments. 

<br/>5. Evaluate – being able to judge the value of information and/or sources of information based on personal values or opinions. 

<br/>6. Create – the ability to creatively or uniquely apply prior knowledge and/or skills to produce new and original thoughts, ideas, processes, etc. At this level, students are involved in creating their own thoughts and ideas.
